The screams of millions could be heard for miles. As soon as the lights went out for the last time the suffering started and continued without respite. It seemed random; men, women and children screaming in... agony? Fear? The rest of us did not know. What I did know however was that it was time for me to leave. I packed what little I could carry into a bag and left my family writhing and whimpering on the floor. # pause
The City always disgusted me. Vast towers of flat grey rock stretching to impossible heights; plains of concrete of unknown purpose twisted and melting between the towers and places unseen. I never figured out if it was just me, or if everyone else felt this way too. Maybe screaming was not such an unusual reaction after all. # pause
As I walked through the abandoned streets an overwhelming sensation of dread hung in the air.
-> DONE
