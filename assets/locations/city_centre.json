    "description": "The screams of millions could be heard for miles. As soon as the lights went out for the last time they started and did not stop once. It seemed random; men, women and children screaming in... agony? Fear? The rest of us did not know. What I did know however was that it was time for me to leave. I packed what little I could carry into a bag and left my family writhing and whimpering on the floor."
