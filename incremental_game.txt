Game about forcing yourself to live.

Have to leave your house in the morning, start off just getting out of bed.

Amount of tasks/gameplay increases over the course of the morning, before it is finally time to leave. It's an incremental game!

If you do badly at living, you regress until you end up back in bed again.

TASKS:
- Make breakfast (toast and you can burn it)
- Check phone
- Shower
- Brush teeth
- Get out of bed
- Pack bag

For since you are late, you must manage all these simultaneously.
